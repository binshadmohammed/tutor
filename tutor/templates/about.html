            <p>Education literally means the things a person learns by being taught.
So, the definition of a good education would be the things a person learns by being taught well. But what exactly does that mean? No one has ever told you that, right. To me a good education is basically achieved when a person has a general to specific knowledge of the things that have happened in the world, things that could happen in the future of the world, how to communicate with others, and how to live safely in the world today....</p>
